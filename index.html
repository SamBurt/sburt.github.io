        <p> In May 2018, I graduated from Colgate University magna cum laude with a
          degree in Computer Science. As well as graduating with honors in Computer
          Science, I also minored in History. My education taught me the value
          of examining problems from a variety of academic angles. I believe in
          the necessity of continuous intellectual pursuits to further my passions
          and career.

          I am an extremely driven software engineer who believes in the power
          of the process of design to create products that validate the user's needs.
          I am a proficient programmer in Java, Ruby, Python, C, HTML and CSS. I
          have also done some work with javascript, golang and SQL. As a programmer, I
          believe in writing robust and concise code that works to solve novel
          problems. While at school, I worked on several projects that focussed on
          engaging with the community and using technology to solve a problem that
          was afflicting the community. I created applications using Ruby on Rails
          and the ionic platform that effectively and efficiently aided the community.
          I am passionate about technology and I am driven to learn and experience
          more.

          Beyond me education pursuits, I work to spend as much time as I can in
          the outdoors and learning new skills. While at Colgate, I was part of
          the college's Outdoor Education program. This program taught me the value
          of escaping to the outdoors, whether for a day or a longer trip. I am a frequent
          hiker, canoeing and skier but I am always looking to try new things and
          expand upon my skill set.

          I pride myself on being an exceptional leader among my peers. Through
          my experience as a Staff Development Director and Staff Trainer for my
          Outdoor Education program, I learned how to be an effective designated,
          peer and self-leader. I pride myself on my ability to work with anyone and
          my understanding of my own personal strengths and weaknesses. I understand
          the importance of leadership in an effective team, and the different ways
          leadership can present itself.
